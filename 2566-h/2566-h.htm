<h1>HOW TO FAIL IN LITERATURE: A LECTURE BY ANDREW LANG</h1>
<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p><i>This Lecture was delivered at the South Kensington Museum, in
aid of the College for Working Men and Women.&nbsp; As the Publishers,
perhaps erroneously, believe that some of the few authors who were not
present may be glad to study the advice here proffered, the Lecture
is now printed.&nbsp; It has been practically re-written, and, like
the kiss which the Lady returned to Rodolphe</i>, is revu, corrig&eacute;,
et considerablement augment&eacute;.</p>
<p>A. L.</p>
<h2>HOW TO FAIL IN LITERATURE</h2>
<p>What should be a man&rsquo;s or a woman&rsquo;s reason for taking
literature as a vocation, what sort of success ought they to desire,
what sort of ambition should possess them?&nbsp; These are natural questions,
now that so many readers exist in the world, all asking for something
new, now that so many writers are making their pens &ldquo;in running
to devour the way&rdquo; over so many acres of foolscap.&nbsp; The legitimate
reasons for enlisting (too often without receiving the shilling) in
this army of writers are not far to seek.&nbsp; A man may be convinced
that he has useful, or beautiful, or entertaining ideas within him,
he may hold that he can express them in fresh and charming language.&nbsp;
He may, in short, have a &ldquo;vocation,&rdquo; or feel conscious of
a vocation, which is not exactly the same thing.&nbsp; There are &ldquo;many
thyrsus bearers, few mystics,&rdquo; many are called, few chosen.&nbsp;
Still, to be sensible of a vocation is something, nay, is much, for
most of us drift without any particular aim or predominant purpose.&nbsp;
Nobody can justly censure people whose chief interest is in letters,
whose chief pleasure is in study or composition, who rejoice in a fine
sentence as others do in a well modelled limb, or a delicately touched
landscape, nobody can censure them for trying their fortunes in literature.&nbsp;
Most of them will fail, for, as the bookseller&rsquo;s young man told
an author once, they have the poetic temperament, without the poetic
power.&nbsp; Still among these whom <i>Pendennis</i> has tempted, in
boyhood, to run away from school to literature as Marryat has tempted
others to run away to sea, there must be some who will succeed.&nbsp;
But an early and intense ambition is not everything, any more than a
capacity for taking pains is everything in literature or in any art.</p>
<p>Some have the gift, the natural incommunicable power, without the
ambition, others have the ambition but no other gift from any Muse.&nbsp;
This class is the more numerous, but the smallest class of all has both
the power and the will to excel in letters.&nbsp; The desire to write,
the love of letters may shew itself in childhood, in boyhood, or youth,
and mean nothing at all, a mere harvest of barren blossom without fragrance
or fruit.&nbsp; Or, again, the concern about letters may come suddenly,
when a youth that cared for none of those things is waning, it may come
when a man suddenly finds that he has something which he really must
tell.&nbsp; Then he probably fumbles about for a style, and his first
fresh impulses are more or less marred by his inexperience of an art
which beguiles and fascinates others even in their school-days.</p>
<p>It is impossible to prophesy the success of a man of letters from
his early promise, his early tastes; as impossible as it is to predict,
from her childish grace, the beauty of a woman.</p>
<p>But the following remarks on How to fail in Literature are certainly
meant to discourage nobody who loves books, and has an impulse to tell
a story, or to try a song or a sermon.&nbsp; Discouragements enough
exist in the pursuit of this, as of all arts, crafts, and professions,
without my adding to them.&nbsp; Famine and Fear crouch by the portals
of literature as they crouch at the gates of the Virgilian Hades.&nbsp;
There is no more frequent cause of failure than doubt and dread; a beginner
can scarcely put his heart and strength into a work when he knows how
long are the odds against his victory, how difficult it is for a new
man to win a hearing, even though all editors and publishers are ever
pining for a new man.&nbsp; The young fellow, unknown and unwelcomed,
who can sit down and give all his best of knowledge, observation, humour,
care, and fancy to a considerable work has got courage in no common
portion; he deserves to triumph, and certainly should not be disheartened
by our old experience.&nbsp; But there be few beginners of this mark,
most begin so feebly because they begin so fearfully.&nbsp; They are
already too discouraged, and can scarce do themselves justice.&nbsp;
It is easier to write more or less well and agreeably when you are certain
of being published and paid, at least, than to write well when a dozen
rejected manuscripts are cowering (as Theocritus says) in your chest,
bowing their pale faces over their chilly knees, outcast, hungry, repulsed
from many a door.&nbsp; To write excellently, brightly, powerfully,
with these poor unwelcomed wanderers, returned MSS., in your possession,
is difficult indeed.&nbsp; It might be wiser to do as M. Guy de Maupassant
is rumoured to have done, to write for seven years, and shew your essays
to none but a mentor as friendly severe as M. Flaubert.&nbsp; But all
men cannot have such mentors, nor can all afford so long an unremunerative
apprenticeship.&nbsp; For some the better plan is <i>not</i> to linger
on the bank, and take tea and good advice, as Keats said, but to plunge
at once in mid-stream, and learn swimming of necessity.</p>
<p>One thing, perhaps, most people who succeed in letters so far as
to keep themselves alive and clothed by their pens will admit, namely,
that their early rejected MSS. <i>deserved to be rejected</i>.&nbsp;
A few days ago there came to the writer an old forgotten beginner&rsquo;s
attempt by himself.&nbsp; Whence it came, who sent it, he knows not;
he had forgotten its very existence.&nbsp; He read it with curiosity;
it was written in a very much better hand than his present scrawl, and
was perfectly legible.&nbsp; But <i>readable</i> it was not.&nbsp; There
was a great deal of work in it, on an out of the way topic, and the
ideas were, perhaps, not quite without novelty at the time of its composition.&nbsp;
But it was cramped and thin, and hesitating between several manners;
above all it was uncommonly dull.&nbsp; If it ever was sent to an editor,
as I presume it must have been, that editor was trebly justified in
declining it.&nbsp; On the other hand, to be egotistic, I have known
editors reject the attempts of those old days, and afterwards express
lively delight in them when they struggled into print, somehow, somewhere.&nbsp;
These worthy men did not even know that they had despised and refused
what they came afterwards rather to enjoy.</p>
<p>Editors and publishers, these keepers of the gates of success, are
not infallible, but their opinion of a beginner&rsquo;s work is far
more correct than his own can ever be.&nbsp; They should not depress
him quite, but if they are long unanimous in holding him cheap, he is
warned, and had better withdraw from the struggle.&nbsp; He is either
incompetent, or he has the makings of a Browning.&nbsp; He is a genius
born too soon.&nbsp; He may readily calculate the chances in favour
of either alternative.</p>
<p>So much by way of not damping all neophytes equally: so much we may
say about success before talking of the easy ways that lead to failure.&nbsp;
And by success here is meant no glorious triumph; the laurels are not
in our thoughts, nor the enormous opulence (about a fourth of a fortunate
barrister&rsquo;s gains) which falls in the lap of a Dickens or a Trollope.&nbsp;
Faint and fleeting praise, a crown with as many prickles as roses, a
modest hardly-gained competence, a good deal of envy, a great deal of
gossip&mdash;these are the rewards of genius which constitute a modern
literary success.&nbsp; Not to reach the moderate competence in literature
is, for a professional man of letters of all work, something like failure.&nbsp;
But in poetry to-day a man may succeed, as far as his art goes, and
yet may be unread, and may publish at his own expense, or not publish
at all.&nbsp; He pleases himself, and a very tiny audience: I do not
call that failure.&nbsp; I regard failure as the goal of ignorance,
incompetence, lack of common sense, conceited dulness, and certain practical
blunders now to be explained and defined.</p>
<p>The most ambitious may accept, without distrust, the following advice
as to How to fail in Literature.&nbsp; The advice is offered by a mere
critic, and it is an axiom of the Arts that the critics &ldquo;are the
fellows who have failed,&rdquo; or have not succeeded.&nbsp; The persons
who really can paint, or play, or compose seldom tell us how it is done,
still less do they review the performances of their contemporaries.&nbsp;
That invidious task they leave to the unsuccessful novelists.&nbsp;
The instruction, the advice are offered by the persons who cannot achieve
performance.&nbsp; It is thus that all things work together in favour
of failure, which, indeed, may well appear so easy that special instruction,
however competent, is a luxury rather than a necessary.&nbsp; But when
we look round on the vast multitude of writers who, to all seeming,
deliberately aim at failure, who take every precaution in favour of
failure that untutored inexperience can suggest, it becomes plain that
education in ill-success, is really a popular want.&nbsp; In the following
remarks some broad general principles, making disaster almost inevitable,
will first be offered, and then special methods of failing in all special
departments of letters will be ungrudgingly communicated.&nbsp; It is
not enough to attain failure, we should deserve it.&nbsp; The writer,
by way of insuring complete confidence, would modestly mention that
he has had ample opportunities of study in this branch of knowledge.&nbsp;
While sifting for five or six years the volunteered contributions to
a popular periodical, he has received and considered some hundredweights
of manuscript.&nbsp; In all these myriad contributions he has not found
thirty pieces which rose even to the ordinary dead level of magazine
work.&nbsp; He has thus enjoyed unrivalled chances of examining such
modes of missing success as spontaneously occur to the human intellect,
to the unaided ingenuity of men, women, and children. <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1">{1}</a></p>
<p>He who would fail in literature cannot begin too early to neglect
his education, and to adopt every opportunity of not observing life
and character.&nbsp; None of us is so young but that he may make himself
perfect in writing an illegible hand.&nbsp; This method, I am bound
to say, is too frequently overlooked.&nbsp; Most manuscripts by ardent
literary volunteers are fairly legible.&nbsp; On the other hand there
are novelists, especially ladies, who not only write a hand wholly declining
to let itself be deciphered, but who fill up the margins with interpolations,
who write between the lines, and who cover the page with scratches running
this way and that, intended to direct the attention to after-thoughts
inserted here and there in corners and on the backs of sheets.&nbsp;
To pin in scraps of closely written paper and backs of envelopes adds
to the security for failure, and produces a rich anger in the publisher&rsquo;s
reader or the editor.</p>
<p>The cultivation of a bad handwriting is an elementary precaution,
often overlooked.&nbsp; Few need to be warned against having their MSS.
typewritten, this gives them a chance of being read with ease and interest,
and this must be neglected by all who have really set their hearts on
failure.&nbsp; In the higher matters of education it is well to be as
ignorant as possible.&nbsp; No knowledge comes amiss to the true man
of letters, so they who court disaster should know as little as may
be.</p>
<p>Mr. Stevenson has told the attentive world how, in boyhood, he practised
himself in studying and imitating the styles of famous authors of every
age.&nbsp; He who aims at failure must never think of style, and should
sedulously abstain from reading Shakespeare, Bacon, Hooker, Walton,
Gibbon, and other English and foreign classics.&nbsp; He can hardly
be too reckless of grammar, and should always place adverbs and other
words between &ldquo;to&rdquo; and the infinitive, thus: &ldquo;Hubert
was determined to energetically and on all possible occasions, oppose
any attempt to entangle him with such.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, it will be
noticed, &ldquo;such&rdquo; is used as a pronoun, a delightful flower
of speech not to be disregarded by authors who would fail.&nbsp; But
some one may reply that several of our most popular novelists revel
in the kind of grammar which I am recommending.&nbsp; This is undeniable,
but certain people manage to succeed in spite of their own earnest endeavours
and startling demerits.&nbsp; There is no royal road to failure.&nbsp;
There is no rule without its exception, and it may be urged that the
works of the gentlemen and ladies who &ldquo;break Priscian&rsquo;s
head&rdquo;&mdash;as they would say themselves&mdash;may be successful,
but are not literature.&nbsp; Now it is about literature that we are
speaking.</p>
<p>In the matter of style, there is another excellent way.&nbsp; You
need not neglect it, but you may study it wrongly.&nbsp; You may be
affectedly self-conscious, you may imitate the ingenious persons who
carefully avoid the natural word, the spontaneous phrase, and employ
some other set of terms which can hardly be construed.&nbsp; You may
use, like a young essayist whom I have lovingly observed, a proportion
of eighty adjectives to every sixty-five other words of all denominations.&nbsp;
You may hunt for odd words, and thrust them into the wrong places, as
where you say that a man&rsquo;s nose is &ldquo;beetling,&rdquo; that
the sun sank in &ldquo;a cauldron of daffodil chaos,&rdquo; and the
like. <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2">{2}</a>&nbsp; You
may use common words in an unwonted sense, keeping some private interpretation
clearly before you.&nbsp; Thus you may speak, if you like to write partly
in the tongue of Hellas, about &ldquo;assimilating the <i>&ecirc;thos</i>&rdquo;
of a work of art, and so write that people shall think of the processes
of digestion.&nbsp; You may speak of &ldquo;exhausting the beauty&rdquo;
of a landscape, and, somehow, convey the notion of sucking an orange
dry.&nbsp; Or you may wildly mix your metaphors, as when a critic accuses
Mr. Browning of &ldquo;giving the irridescence of the poetic afflatus,&rdquo;
as if the poetic afflatus were blown through a pipe, into soap, and
produced soap bubbles.&nbsp; This is a more troublesome method than
the mere picking up of every newspaper commonplace that floats into
your mind, but it is equally certain to lead&mdash;where you want to
go.&nbsp; By combining the two fashions a great deal may be done.&nbsp;
Thus you want to describe a fire at sea, and you say, &ldquo;the devouring
element lapped the quivering spars, the mast, and the sea-shouldering
keel of the doomed <i>Mary Jane</i> in one coruscating catastrophe.&nbsp;
The sea deeps were incarnadined to an alarming extent by the flames,
and to escape from such many plunged headlong in their watery bier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a rule, authors who would fail stick to one bad sort of writing;
either to the newspaper commonplace, or to the out of the way and inappropriate
epithets, or to the common word with a twist on it.&nbsp; But there
are examples of the combined method, as when we call the trees round
a man&rsquo;s house his &ldquo;domestic boscage.&rdquo;&nbsp; This combination
is difficult, but perfect for its purpose.&nbsp; You cannot write worse
than &ldquo;such.&rdquo;&nbsp; To attain perfection the young aspirant
should confine his reading to the newspapers (carefully selecting his
newspapers, for many of them will not help him to write ill) and to
those modern authors who are most praised for their style by the people
who know least about the matter.&nbsp; Words like &ldquo;fictional&rdquo;
and &ldquo;fictive&rdquo; are distinctly to be recommended, and there
are epithets such as &ldquo;weird,&rdquo; &ldquo;strange,&rdquo; &ldquo;wild,&rdquo;
&ldquo;intimate,&rdquo; and the rest, which blend pleasantly with &ldquo;all
the time&rdquo; for &ldquo;always&rdquo;; &ldquo;back of&rdquo; for
&ldquo;behind&rdquo;; &ldquo;belong with&rdquo; for &ldquo;belong to&rdquo;;
&ldquo;live like I do&rdquo; for &ldquo;as I do.&rdquo;&nbsp; The authors
who combine those charms are rare, but we can strive to be among them.</p>
<p>In short, he who would fail must avoid simplicity like a sunken reef,
and must earnestly seek either the commonplace or the <i>bizarre</i>,
the slipshod or the affected, the newfangled or the obsolete, the flippant
or the sepulchral.&nbsp; I need not specially recommend you to write
in &ldquo;Wardour-street English,&rdquo; the sham archaic, a lingo never
spoken by mortal man, and composed of patches borrowed from authors
between Piers Plowman and Gabriel Harvey.&nbsp; A few literal translations
of Icelandic phrases may be thrown in; the result, as furniture-dealers
say, is a &ldquo;made-up article.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the subject of style another hint may be offered.&nbsp; Style
may be good in itself, but inappropriate to the subject.&nbsp; For example,
style which may be excellently adapted to a theological essay, may be
but ill-suited for a dialogue in a novel.&nbsp; There are subjects of
which the poet says</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Ornari res ipsa vetat, contenta doceri</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The matter declines to be adorned, and is content with being clearly
stated.&nbsp; I do not know what would occur if the writer of the Money
Article in the <i>Times</i> treated his topic with reckless gaiety.&nbsp;
Probably that number of the journal in which the essay appeared would
have a large sale, but the author might achieve professional failure;
in the office.&nbsp; On the whole it may not be the wiser plan to write
about the Origins of Religion in the style which might suit a study
of the life of ballet dancers; the two MM. Hal&eacute;vy, the learned
and the popular, would make a blunder if they exchanged styles.&nbsp;
Yet Gibbon never denies himself a jest, and Montesquieu&rsquo;s <i>Esprit
des Lois</i> was called <i>L&rsquo;Esprit sur les Lois</i>.&nbsp; M.
Renan&rsquo;s <i>Histoire d&rsquo;Israel</i> may almost be called skittish.&nbsp;
The French are more tolerant of those excesses than the English.&nbsp;
It is a digression, but he who would fail can reach his end by not taking
himself seriously.&nbsp; If he gives himself no important airs, whether
out of a freakish humour, or real humility, depend upon it the public
and the critics will take him at something under his own estimate.&nbsp;
On the other hand, by copying the gravity of demeanour admired by Mr.
Shandy in a celebrated parochial animal, even a very dull person may
succeed in winning no inconsiderable reputation.</p>
<p>To return to style, and its appropriateness: all depends on the work
in hand, and the audience addressed.&nbsp; Thus, in his valuable Essay
on Style, Mr. Pater says, with perfect truth: <a name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3">{3}</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The otiose, the facile, surplusage: why are these abhorrent
to the true literary artist, except because, in literary as in all other
arts, structure is all important, felt or painfully missed, everywhere?&mdash;that
architectural conception of work, which foresees the end in the beginning,
and never loses sight of it, and in every part is conscious of all the
rest, till the last sentence does but, with undiminished vigour, unfold
and justify the first&mdash;a condition of literary art, which, in contradistinction
to another quality of the artist himself, to be spoken of later, I shall
call the necessity of <i>mind</i> in style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These are words which the writer should have always present to his
memory, if he has something serious that he wants to say, or if he wishes
to express himself in the classic and perfect manner.&nbsp; But if it
is his fate merely to be obliged to say something, in the course of
his profession, or if he is bid to discourse for the pleasure of readers
in the Underground Railway, I fear he will often have to forget Mr.
Pater.&nbsp; It may not be literature, the writing of <i>causeries</i>,
of Roundabout Papers, of rambling articles &ldquo;on a broomstick,&rdquo;
and yet again, it <i>may</i> be literature!&nbsp; &ldquo;Parallel, allusion,
the allusive way generally, the flowers in the garden&rdquo;&mdash;Mr.
Pater charges heavily against these.&nbsp; The true artist &ldquo;knows
the narcotic force of these upon the negligent intelligence to which
any <i>diversion</i>, literally, is welcome, any vagrant intruder, because
one can go wandering away with it from the immediate subject . . . In
truth all art does but consist in the removal of surplusage, from the
last finish of the gem engraver blowing away the last particle of invisible
dust, back to the earliest divination of the finished work to be lying
somewhere, according to Michel Angelo&rsquo;s fancy, in the rough-hewn
block of stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Excellent, but does this apply to every kind of literary art?&nbsp;
What would become of Montaigne if you blew away his allusions, and drove
him out of &ldquo;the allusive way,&rdquo; where he gathers and binds
so many flowers from all the gardens and all the rose-hung lanes of
literature?&nbsp; Montaigne sets forth to write an Essay on Coaches.&nbsp;
He begins with a few remarks on seasickness in the common pig; some
notes on the Pont Neuf at Paris follow, and a theory of why tyrants
are detested by men whom they have obliged; a glance at Coaches is then
given, next a study of Montezuma&rsquo;s gardens, presently a brief
account of the Spanish cruelties in Mexico and Peru, last&mdash;<i>retombons
&agrave; nos coches</i>&mdash;he tells a tale of the Inca, and the devotion
of his Guard: <i>Another for Hector</i>!</p>
<p>The allusive style has its proper place, like another, if it is used
by the right man, and the concentrated and structural style has also
its higher province.&nbsp; It would not do to employ either style in
the wrong place.&nbsp; In a rambling discursive essay, for example,
a mere straying after the bird in the branches, or the thorn in the
way, he might not take the safest road who imitated Mr. Pater&rsquo;s
style in what follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this way, according to the well-known saying, &lsquo;The
style is the man,&rsquo; complex or simple, in his individuality, his
plenary sense of what he really has to say, his sense of the world:
all cautions regarding style arising out of so many natural scruples
as to the medium through which alone he can expose that inward sense
of things, the purity of this medium, its laws or tricks of refraction:
nothing is to be left there which might give conveyance to any matter
save that.&rdquo;&nbsp; Clearly the author who has to write so that
the man may read who runs will fail if he wrests this manner from its
proper place, and uses it for casual articles: he will fail to hold
the vagrom attention!</p>
<p>Thus a great deal may be done by studying inappropriateness of style,
by adopting a style alien to our matter and to our audience.&nbsp; If
we &ldquo;haver&rdquo; discursively about serious, and difficult, and
intricate topics, we fail; and we fail if we write on happy, pleasant,
and popular topics in an abstruse and intent, and analytic style.&nbsp;
We fail, too, if in style we go outside our natural selves.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
style is the man,&rdquo; and the man will be nothing, and nobody, if
he tries for an incongruous manner, not naturally his own, for example
if Miss Yonge were suddenly to emulate the manner of Lever, or if Mr.
John Morley were to strive to shine in the fashion of <i>Uncle Remus</i>,
or if Mr. Rider Haggard were to be allured into imitation by the example,
so admirable in itself, of the Master of Balliol.&nbsp; It is ourselves
we must try to improve, our attentiveness, our interest in life, our
seriousness of purpose, and then the style will improve with the self.&nbsp;
Or perhaps, to be perfectly frank, we shall thus convert ourselves into
prigs, throw ourselves out of our stride, lapse into self-consciousness,
lose all that is natural, <i>naif</i>, and instinctive within us.&nbsp;
Verily there are many dangers, and the paths to failure are infinite.</p>
<p>So much for style, of which it may generally be said that you cannot
be too obscure, unnatural, involved, vulgar, slipshod, and metaphorical.&nbsp;
See to it that your metaphors are mixed, though, perhaps, this attention
is hardly needed.&nbsp; The free use of parentheses, in which a reader
gets lost, and of unintelligible allusions, and of references to unread
authors&mdash;the <i>Kalevala</i> and Lycophron, and the Scholiast on
Apollonius Rhodius, is invaluable to this end.&nbsp; So much for manner,
and now for matter.</p>
<p>The young author generally writes because he wants to write, either
for money, from vanity, or in mere weariness of empty hours and anxiety
to astonish his relations.&nbsp; This is well, he who would fail cannot
begin better than by having nothing to say.&nbsp; The less you observe,
the less you reflect, the less you put yourself in the paths of adventure
and experience, the less you will have to say, and the more impossible
will it be to read your work.&nbsp; Never notice people&rsquo;s manner,
conduct, nor even dress, in real life.&nbsp; Walk through the world
with your eyes and ears closed, and embody the negative results in a
story or a poem.&nbsp; As to Poetry, with a fine instinct we generally
begin by writing verse, because verse is the last thing that the public
want to read.&nbsp; The young writer has usually read a great deal of
verse, however, and most of it bad.&nbsp; His favourite authors are
the bright lyrists who sing of broken hearts, wasted lives, early deaths,
disappointment, gloom.&nbsp; Without having even had an unlucky flirtation,
or without knowing what it is to lose a favourite cat, the early author
pours forth laments, just like the laments he has been reading.&nbsp;
He has too a favourite manner, the old consumptive manner, about the
hectic flush, the fatal rose on the pallid cheek, about the ruined roof
tree, the empty chair, the rest in the village churchyard.&nbsp; This
is now a little <i>rococo</i> and forlorn, but failure may be assured
by travelling in this direction.&nbsp; If you are ambitious to disgust
an editor at once, begin your poem with &ldquo;Only.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
fact you may as well head the lyric &ldquo;Only.&rdquo; <a name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4">{4}</a></p>
<blockquote><p>ONLY.</p>
<p>Only a spark of an ember,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Only a leaf on the tree,<br />
Only the days we remember,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the days without thee.<br />
Only the flower that thou worest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the book that we read,<br />
Only that night in the forest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Only a dream of the dead,<br />
Only the troth that was broken,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the heart that is lonely,<br />
Only the sigh and the token<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That sob in the saying of Only!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In literature this is a certain way of failing, but I believe a person
might make a livelihood by writing verses like these&mdash;for music.&nbsp;
Another good way is to be very economical in your rhymes, only two to
the four lines, and regretfully vague.&nbsp; Thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>SHADOWS.</p>
<p>In the slumber of the winter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the secret of the snow,<br />
What is the voice that is crying<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of the long ago?</p>
<p>When the accents of the children<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are silent on the stairs,<br />
When the poor forgets his troubles,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the rich forgets his cares.</p>
<p>What is the silent whisper<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That echoes in the room,<br />
When the days are full of darkness,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the night is hushed in gloom?</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis the voice of the departed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who will never come again,<br />
Who has left the weary tumult,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the struggle and the pain. <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5">{5}</a></p>
<p>And my heart makes heavy answer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the voice that comes no more,<br />
To the whisper that is welling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the far off happy shore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are not satisfied with these simple ways of not succeeding,
please try the Grosvenor Gallery style.&nbsp; Here the great point is
to make the rhyme arrive at the end of a very long word, you should
also be free with your alliterations.</p>
<blockquote><p>LULLABY.</p>
<p>When the sombre night is dumb,<br />
Hushed the loud chrysanthemum,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sister, sleep!<br />
Sleep, the lissom lily saith,<br />
Sleep, the poplar whispereth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Soft and deep!</p>
<p>Filmy floats the wild woodbine,<br />
Jonquil, jacinth, jessamine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Float and flow.<br />
Sleeps the water wild and wan,<br />
As in far off Toltecan<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mexico.</p>
<p>See, upon the sun-dial,<br />
Waves the midnight&rsquo;s misty pall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Waves and wakes.<br />
As, in tropic Timbuctoo,<br />
Water beasts go plashing through<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lilied lakes!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alliteration is a splendid source of failure in this sort of poetry,
and adjectives like lissom, filmy, weary, weird, strange, make, or ought
to make, the rejection of your manuscript a certainty.&nbsp; The poem
should, as a rule, seem to be addressed to an unknown person, and should
express regret and despair for circumstances in the past with which
the reader is totally unacquainted.&nbsp; Thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>GHOSTS.</p>
<p>We met at length, as Souls that sit<br />
At funeral feast, and taste of it,<br />
And empty were the words we said,<br />
As fits the converse of the dead,<br />
For it is long ago, my dear,<br />
Since we two met in living cheer,<br />
Yea, we have long been ghosts, you know,<br />
And alien ways we twain must go,<br />
Nor shall we meet in Shadow Land,<br />
Till Time&rsquo;s glass, empty of its sand,<br />
Is filled up of Eternity.<br />
Farewell&mdash;enough for once to die&mdash;<br />
And far too much it is to dream,<br />
And taste not the Leth&aelig;an stream,<br />
But bear the pain of loves unwed<br />
Even here, even here, among the dead!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is a cheerful intelligible kind of melody, which is often practised
with satisfactory results.&nbsp; Every form of imitation (imitating
of course only the faults of a favourite writer) is to be recommended.</p>
<p>Imitation does a double service, it secures the failure of the imitator
and also aids that of the unlucky author who is imitated.&nbsp; As soon
as a new thing appears in literature, many people hurry off to attempt
something of the same sort.&nbsp; It may be a particular trait and accent
in poetry, and the public, weary of the mimicries, begin to dislike
the original.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Most can grow the flowers now,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For all have got the seed;<br />
And once again the people<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Call it but a weed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fiction, if somebody brings in a curious kind of murder, or a
study of religious problems, or a treasure hunt, or what you will, others
imitate till the world is weary of murders, or theological flirtations,
or the search for buried specie, and the original authors themselves
will fail, unless they fish out something new, to be vulgarised afresh.&nbsp;
Therefore, imitation is distinctly to be urged on the young author.</p>
<p>As a rule, his method is this, he reads very little, but all that
he reads is <i>bad</i>.&nbsp; The feeblest articles in the weakliest
magazines, the very mildest and most conventional novels appear to be
the only studies of the majority.&nbsp; Apparently the would-be contributor
says to himself, or herself, &ldquo;well, <i>I</i> can do something
almost on the level of this or that maudlin and invertebrate novel.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then he deliberately sits down to rival the most tame, dull, and illiterate
compositions that get into print.&nbsp; In this way bad authors become
the literary parents of worse authors.&nbsp; Nobody but a reader of
MSS. knows what myriads of fiction are written without one single new
situation, original character, or fresh thought.&nbsp; The most out-worn
ideas: sudden loss of fortune; struggles; faithlessness of First Lover;
noble conduct of Second Lover: frivolity of younger sister; excellence
of mother: naughtiness of one son, virtue of another, these are habitually
served up again and again.&nbsp; On the sprained ankles, the mad bulls,
the fires, and other simple devices for doing without an introduction
between hero and heroine I need not dwell.&nbsp; The very youngest of
us is acquainted with these expedients, which, by this time of day,
will spell failure.</p>
<p>The common novels of Governess life, the daughters and granddaughters
of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, still run riot among the rejected manuscripts.&nbsp;
The lively large family, all very untidy and humorous, all wearing each
other&rsquo;s boots and gloves, and making their dresses out of bedroom
curtains and marrying rich men, still rushes down the easy descent to
failure.&nbsp; The sceptical curate is at large, and is disbelieving
in everything except the virtues of the young woman who &ldquo;has a
history.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Swinburne hopes that one day the last unbelieving
clergyman will disappear in the embrace of the last immaculate Magdalen,
as the Princess and the Geni burn each other to nothingness, in the
<i>Arabian Nights</i>.&nbsp; On that happy day there will be one less
of the roads leading to failure.&nbsp; If the pair can carry with them
the self-sacrificing characters who take the blame of all the felonies
that they did not do, and the nice girl who is jilted by the poet, and
finds that the squire was the person whom she <i>really</i> loved, so
much the better.&nbsp; If not only Monte Carlo, but the inevitable scene
in the Rooms there can be abolished; if the Riviera, and Italy can be
removed from the map of Europe as used by novelists, so much the better.&nbsp;
But failure will always be secured, while the huge majority of authors
do not aim high, but aim at being a little lower than the last domestic
drivel which came out in three volumes, or the last analysis of the
inmost self of some introspective young girl which crossed the water
from the States.</p>
<p>These are general counsels, and apply to the production of books.&nbsp;
But, when you have done your book, you may play a number of silly tricks
with your manuscript.&nbsp; I have already advised you to make only
one copy, a rough one, as that secures negligence in your work, and
also disgusts an editor or reader.&nbsp; It has another advantage, you
may lose your copy altogether, and, as you have not another, no failure
can be more complete.&nbsp; The best way of losing it, I think and the
safest, is to give it to somebody you know who has once met some man
or woman of letters..&nbsp; This somebody must be instructed to ask
that busy and perhaps casual and untidy person to read your manuscript,
and &ldquo;place&rdquo; it, that is, induce some poor publisher or editor
to pay for and publish it.&nbsp; Now the man, or woman of letters, will
use violent language on receiving your clumsy brown paper parcel of
illegible wares, because he or she has no more to do with the matter
than the crossing sweeper.&nbsp; The MS. will either be put away so
carefully that it can never be found again, or will be left lying about
so that the housemaid may use it for her own domestic purposes, like
Betty Barnes, the cook of Mr. Warburton, who seems to have burned several
plays of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>The MS. in short will go where the old moons go.</p>
<blockquote><p>And all dead days drift thither,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all disastrous things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only can you secure failure thus yourself, but you can so worry
and badger your luckless victim, that he too will be unable to write
well till he has forgotten you and your novel, and all the annoyance
and anxiety you have given him.&nbsp; Much may be done by asking him
for &ldquo;introductions&rdquo; to an editor or publisher.&nbsp; These
gentry don&rsquo;t want introductions, they want good books, and very
seldom get them.&nbsp; If you behave thus, the man whom you are boring
will write to his publisher:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Brown,</p>
<p>A wretched creature, who knows my great aunt, asks me to recommend
his rubbish to you.&nbsp; I send it by to-day&rsquo;s post, and I wish
you joy of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This kind of introduction will do you excellent service in smoothing
the path to failure.&nbsp; You can arrive at similar results by sending
your MS. <i>not</i> to the editor of this or that magazine, but to some
one who, as you have been told by some nincompoop, is the editor, and
who is <i>not</i>.&nbsp; He <i>may</i> lose your book, or he may let
it lie about for months, or he may send it on at once to the real editor
with his bitter malison.&nbsp; The utmost possible vexation is thus
inflicted on every hand, and a prejudice is established against you
which the nature of your work is very unlikely to overcome.&nbsp; By
all means bore many literary strangers with correspondence, this will
give them a lively recollection of your name, and an intense desire
to do you a bad turn if opportunity arises. <a name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6">{6}</a></p>
<p>If your book does, in spite of all, get itself published, send it
with your compliments to critics and ask them for favourable reviews.&nbsp;
It is the publisher&rsquo;s business to send out books to the editors
of critical papers, but never mind <i>that</i>.&nbsp; Go on telling
critics that you know praise is only given by favour, that they are
all more or less venal and corrupt and members of the Something Club,
add that <i>you</i> are no member of a <i>c&ocirc;terie</i> nor clique,
but that you hope an exception will be made, and that your volume will
be applauded on its merits.&nbsp; You will thus have done what in you
lies to secure silence from reviewers, and to make them request that
your story may be sent to some other critic.&nbsp; This, again, gives
trouble, and makes people detest you and your performance, and contributes
to the end which you have steadily in view.</p>
<p>I do not think it is necessary to warn young lady novelists, who
possess beauty, wealth, and titles, against asking Reviewers to dine,
and treating them as kindly, almost, as the Fairy Paribanou treated
Prince Ahmed.&nbsp; They only act thus, I fear, in Mr. William Black&rsquo;s
novels.</p>
<p>Much may be done by re-writing your book on the proof sheets, correcting
everything there which you should have corrected in manuscript.&nbsp;
This is an expensive process, and will greatly diminish your pecuniary
gains, or rather will add to your publisher&rsquo;s bill, for the odds
are that you will have to publish at your own expense.&nbsp; By the
way, an author can make almost a certainty of disastrous failure, by
carrying to some small obscure publisher a work which has been rejected
by the best people in the trade.&nbsp; Their rejections all but demonstrate
that your book is worthless.&nbsp; If you think you are likely to make
a good thing by employing an obscure publisher, with little or no capital,
then, as some one in Thucydides remarks, congratulating you on your
simplicity, I do not envy your want of common sense.&nbsp; Be very careful
to enter into a perfectly preposterous agreement.&nbsp; For example,
accept &ldquo;half profits,&rdquo; but forget to observe that before
these are reckoned, it is distinctly stated in your &ldquo;agreement&rdquo;
that the publisher is to pay <i>himself</i> some twenty per cent. on
the price of each copy sold before you get your share.</p>
<p>Here is &ldquo;another way,&rdquo; as the cookery books have it.&nbsp;
In your gratitude to your first publisher, covenant with him to let
him have all the cheap editions of all your novels for the next five
years, at his own terms.&nbsp; If, in spite of the advice I have given
you, you somehow manage to succeed, to become wildly popular, you will
still have reserved to yourself, by this ingenious clause, a chance
of ineffable pecuniary failure.&nbsp; A plan generally approved of is
to sell your entire copyright in your book for a very small sum.&nbsp;
You want the ready money, and perhaps you are not very hopeful.&nbsp;
But, when your book is in all men&rsquo;s hands, when you are daily
reviled by the small fry of paragraphers, when the publisher is clearing
a thousand a year by it, while you only got a hundred down, then you
will thank me, and will acknowledge that, in spite of apparent success,
you are a failure after all.&nbsp; There are publishers, however, so
inconsiderate that they will not leave you even this consolation.&nbsp;
Finding that the book they bought cheap is really valuable, they will
insist on sharing the profits with the author, or on making him great
presents of money to which he has no legal claim.&nbsp; Some persons,
some authors, cannot fail if they would, so wayward is fortune, and
such a Quixotic idea of honesty have some middlemen of literature.&nbsp;
But, of course, you <i>may</i> light on a publisher who will not give
you <i>more</i> than you covenanted for, and then you can go about denouncing
the whole profession as a congregation of robbers and clerks of St.
Nicholas.</p>
<p>The ways of failure are infinite, and of course are not nearly exhausted.&nbsp;
One good plan is never to be yourself when you write, to put in nothing
of your own temperament, manner, character&mdash;or to have none, which
does as well.&nbsp; Another favourite method is to offer the wrong kind
of article, to send to the <i>Cornhill</i> an essay on the evolution
of the Hittite syllabary, (for only one author could make <i>that</i>
popular;) or a sketch of cock fighting among the ancients to the <i>Monthly
Record</i>; or an essay on <i>Ayahs in India</i> to an American magazine;
or a biography of Washington or Lincoln to any English magazine whatever.&nbsp;
We have them every month in some American periodicals, and our poor
insular serials can get on without them: &ldquo;have no use for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a minor, though valuable scheme, to send poems on Christmas
to magazines about the beginning of December, because, in fact, the
editors have laid in their stock of that kind of thing earlier.&nbsp;
Always insist on <i>seeing</i> an editor, instead of writing to him.&nbsp;
There is nothing he hates so much, unless you are very young and beautiful
indeed, when, perhaps, if you wish to fail you had better <i>not</i>
pay him a visit at the office.&nbsp; Even if you do, even if you were
as fair as the Golden Helen, he is not likely to put in your compositions
if, as is probable, they fall <i>much</i> below the level of his magazine.</p>
<p>A good way of making yourself a dead failure is to go about accusing
successful people of plagiarising from books or articles of yours which
did not succeed, and, perhaps, were never published at all.&nbsp; By
encouraging this kind of vanity and spite you may entirely destroy any
small powers you once happened to possess, you will, besides, become
a person with a grievance, and, in the long run, will be shunned even
by your fellow failures.&nbsp; Again, you may plagiarise yourself, if
you can, it is not easy, but it is a safe way to fail if you can manage
it.&nbsp; No successful person, perhaps, was ever, in the strict sense,
a plagiarist, though charges of plagiary are always brought against
everybody, from Virgil to Milton, from Scott to Moli&egrave;re, who
attains success.&nbsp; When you are accused of being a plagiarist, and
shewn up in double columns, you may be pretty sure that all this counsel
has been wasted on you, and that you have failed to fail, after all.&nbsp;
Otherwise nobody would envy and malign you, and garble your book, and
print quotations from it which you did not write, all in the sacred
cause of morality.</p>
<p>Advice on how to secure the reverse of success should not be given
to young authors alone.&nbsp; Their kinsfolk and friends, also, can
do much for their aid.&nbsp; A lady who feels a taste for writing is
very seldom allowed to have a quiet room, a quiet study.&nbsp; If she
retreats to her chill and fireless bed chamber, even there she may be
chevied by her brothers, sisters, and mother.&nbsp; It is noticed that
cousins, and aunts, especially aunts, are of high service in this regard.&nbsp;
They never give an intelligent woman an hour to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Miss Mary in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, but she is very busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she won&rsquo;t mind me, I don&rsquo;t mean to stay long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then in rushes the aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over your books again: my dear!&nbsp; You really should not
overwork yourself.&nbsp; Writing something&rdquo;; here the aunt clutches
the manuscript, and looks at it vaguely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I dare say it&rsquo;s very clever, but I don&rsquo;t
care for this kind of thing myself.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s your mother?&nbsp;
Is Jane better?&nbsp; Now, do tell me, do you get much for writing all
that?&nbsp; Do you send it to the printers, or where?&nbsp; How interesting,
and that reminds me, you that are a novelist, have you heard how shamefully
Miss Baxter was treated by Captain Smith?&nbsp; No, well you might make
something out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here follows the anecdote, at prodigious length, and perfectly incoherent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, write <i>that</i>, and I shall always say I was partly
the author.&nbsp; You really should give me a commission, you know.&nbsp;
Well, good bye, tell your mother I called.&nbsp; Why, there she is,
I declare.&nbsp; Oh, Susan, just come and hear the delightful plot for
a novel that I have been giving Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then she begins again, only further back, this time.</p>
<p>It is thus that the aunts of England may and do assist their nieces
to fail in literature.&nbsp; Many and many a morning do they waste,
many a promising fancy have they blighted, many a temper have they spoiled.</p>
<p>Sisters are rather more sympathetic: the favourite plan of the brother
is to say, &ldquo;Now, Mary, read us your new chapter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary reads it, and the critic exclaims, &ldquo;Well, of all the awful
Rot!&nbsp; Now, why can&rsquo;t you do something like <i>Bootles&rsquo;s
Baby</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fathers never take any interest in the business at all: they do not
count.&nbsp; The sympathy of a mother may be reckoned on, but not her
judgement, for she is either wildly favourable, or, mistrusting her
own tendencies, is more diffident than need be.&nbsp; The most that
relations can do for the end before us is to worry, interrupt, deride,
and tease the literary member of the family.&nbsp; They seldom fail
in these duties, and not even success, as a rule, can persuade them
that there is anything in it but &ldquo;luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps reviewing is not exactly a form of literature.&nbsp; But
it has this merit that people who review badly, not only fail themselves,
but help others to fail, by giving a bad idea of their works.&nbsp;
You will, of course, never read the books you review, and you will be
exhaustively ignorant of the subjects which they treat.&nbsp; But you
can always find fault with the <i>title</i> of the story which comes
into your hands, a stupid reviewer never fails to do this.&nbsp; You
can also copy out as much of the preface as will fill your eighth of
a column, and add, that the performance is not equal to the promise.&nbsp;
You must never feel nor shew the faintest interest in the work reviewed,
that would be fatal.&nbsp; Never praise heartily, that is the sign of
an intelligence not mediocre.&nbsp; Be vague, colourless, and languid,
this deters readers from approaching the book.&nbsp; If you have glanced
at it, blame it for not being what it never professed to be; if it is
a treatise on Greek Prosody, censure the lack of humour; if it is a
volume of gay verses, lament the author&rsquo;s indifference to the
sorrows of the poor or the wrongs of the Armenians.&nbsp; If it has
humour, deplore its lack of thoughtfulness; if it is grave, carp at
its lack of gaiety.&nbsp; I have known a reviewer of half a dozen novels
denounce half a dozen <i>kinds</i> of novels in the course of his two
columns; the romance of adventure, the domestic tale, the psychological
analysis, the theological story, the detective&rsquo;s story, the story
of &ldquo;Society,&rdquo; he blamed them all in general, and the books
before him in particular, also the historical novel.&nbsp; This can
easily be done, by dint of practice, after dipping into three or four
pages of your author.&nbsp; Many reviewers have special aversions, authors
they detest.&nbsp; Whatever they are criticising, novels, poems, plays,
they begin by an attack on their pet aversion, who has nothing to do
with the matter in hand.&nbsp; They cannot praise A, B, C, and D, without
first assailing E.&nbsp; It will generally be found that E is a popular
author.&nbsp; But the great virtue of a reviewer, who would be unreadable
and make others unread, is a languid ignorant lack of interest in all
things, a habit of regarding his work as a tedious task, to be scamped
as rapidly and stupidly as possible.</p>
<p>You might think that these qualities would displease the reviewer&rsquo;s
editor.&nbsp; Not at all, look at any column of short notices, and you
will occasionally find that the critic has anticipated my advice.&nbsp;
There is no topic in which the men who write about it are so little
interested as contemporary literature.&nbsp; Perhaps this is no matter
to marvel at.&nbsp; By the way, a capital plan is not to write your
review till the book has been out for two years.&nbsp; This is the favourite
dodge of the ---, that distinguished journal.</p>
<p>If any one has kindly attended to this discourse, without desiring
to be a failure, he has only to turn the advice outside in.&nbsp; He
has only to be studious of the very best literature, observant, careful,
original, he has only to be himself and not an imitator, to aim at excellence,
and not be content with falling a little lower than mediocrity.&nbsp;
He needs but bestow the same attention on this art as others give to
the other arts and other professions.&nbsp; With these efforts, and
with a native and natural gift, which can never be taught, never communicated,
and with his mind set not on his reward, but on excellence, on style,
on matter, and even on the not wholly unimportant virtue of vivacity,
a man will succeed, or will deserve success.&nbsp; First, of course,
he will have to &ldquo;find&rdquo; himself, as the French say, and if
he does <i>not</i> find an ass, then, like Saul the son of Kish, he
may discover a kingdom.&nbsp; One success he can hardly miss, the happiness
of living, not with trash, but among good books, and &ldquo;the mighty
minds of old.&rdquo;&nbsp; In an unpublished letter of Mr. Thackeray&rsquo;s,
written before he was famous, and a novelist, he says how much he likes
writing on historical subjects, and how he enjoys historical research.&nbsp;
<i>The work is so gentlemanly</i>, he remarks.&nbsp; Often and often,
after the daily dreadful lines, the bread and butter winning lines on
some contemporary folly or frivolity, does a man take up some piece
of work hopelessly unremunerative, foredoomed to failure as far as money
or fame go, some dealing with the classics of the world, Homer or Aristotle,
Lucian or Moli&egrave;re.&nbsp; It is like a bath after a day&rsquo;s
toil, it is tonic and clean; and such studies, if not necessary to success,
are, at least, conducive to mental health and self-respect in literature.</p>
<p>To the enormous majority of persons who risk themselves in literature,
not even the smallest measure of success can fall.&nbsp; They had better
take to some other profession as quickly as may be, they are only making
a sure thing of disappointment, only crowding the narrow gates of fortune
and fame.&nbsp; Yet there are others to whom success, though easily
within their reach, does not seem a thing to be grasped at.&nbsp; Of
two such, the pathetic story may be read, in the Memoir of <i>A Scotch
Probationer</i>, Mr. Thomas Davidson, who died young, an unplaced Minister
of the United Presbyterian Church, in 1869.&nbsp; He died young, unaccepted
by the world, unheard of, uncomplaining, soon after writing his latest
song on the first grey hairs of the lady whom he loved.&nbsp; And she,
Miss Alison Dunlop, died also, a year ago, leaving a little work newly
published, <i>Anent Old Edinburgh</i>, in which is briefly told the
story of her life.&nbsp; There can hardly be a true tale more brave
and honourable, for those two were eminently qualified to shine, with
a clear and modest radiance, in letters.&nbsp; Both had a touch of poetry,
Mr. Davidson left a few genuine poems, both had humour, knowledge, patience,
industry, and literary conscientiousness.&nbsp; No success came to them,
they did not even seek it, though it was easily within the reach of
their powers.&nbsp; Yet none can call them failures, leaving, as they
did, the fragrance of honourable and uncomplaining lives, and such brief
records of these as to delight, and console and encourage us all.&nbsp;
They bequeath to us the spectacle of a real triumph far beyond the petty
gains of money or of applause, the spectacle of lives made happy by
literature, unvexed by notoriety, unfretted by envy.&nbsp; What we call
success could never have yielded them so much, for the ways of authorship
are dusty and stony, and the stones are only too handy for throwing
at the few that, deservedly or undeservedly, make a name, and therewith
about one-tenth of the wealth which is ungrudged to physicians, or barristers,
or stock-brokers, or dentists, or electricians.&nbsp; If literature
and occupation with letters were not its own reward, truly they who
seem to succeed might envy those who fail.&nbsp; It is not wealth that
they win, as fortunate men in other professions count wealth; it is
not rank nor fashion that come to their call nor come to call on them.&nbsp;
Their success is to be let dwell with their own fancies, or with the
imaginations of others far greater than themselves; their success is
this living in fantasy, a little remote from the hubbub and the contests
of the world.&nbsp; At the best they will be vexed by curious eyes and
idle tongues, at the best they will die not rich in this world&rsquo;s
goods, yet not unconsoled by the friendships which they win among men
and women whose faces they will never see.&nbsp; They may well be content,
and thrice content, with their lot, yet it is not a lot which should
provoke envy, nor be coveted by ambition.</p>
<p>It is not an easy goal to attain, as the crowd of aspirants dream,
nor is the reward luxurious when it is attained.&nbsp; A garland, usually
fading and not immortal, has to be run for, not without dust and heat.</p>

all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
